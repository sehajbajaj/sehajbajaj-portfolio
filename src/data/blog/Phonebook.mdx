# Introduction

PhoneBook is a Full-stack web application built using **MERN** Stack. I built this application in order to put my knowledge of what I have learnt till now in practice.

## Salient Features

- A website where users can add, update, delete and search for contact information of people/organizations.

- The front end of the website is created using React and Tailwind CSS.

- Theme of the application can be changed. The user can select any theme from the themes given in the dropdown.

- The back end of the web application is implemented using MongoDB for the database, NodeJS and ExpressJS.

#### Technologies Used -

- Express JS

  title="title of the image"

### The Schema of the database

```js:backend/models/PersonModel.js
const personSchema = new Schema(
  {
    name: {
      type: String,
      requires: true,
      minLength: 3,
      trim: true,
      unique: true,
    },
    number: {
      type: Number,
      required: true,
      minLength: 3,
      maxLength: 10,
      unique: true,
    },
    location: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);
```

The records entered by the users are stored in the database in the above format. The name and the number must be unique.

### Fetching the contact information from the database created.

```js:frontend/src/pages/Home.js
useEffect(() => {
    const fetchPersons = async () => {
      const response = await fetch(
        "https://phonebook-xvm7.onrender.com/api/persons"
      );
      const json = await response.json();
      if (response.ok) {
        setPersons(json);
      }
    };
    fetchPersons();
  }, []);
```

Here, we make a call to the url of the deployed database to fetch the contact information of all the people added by the users.
